## General info
The goal of this assignment are:
- Develop your understanding of the data science/ML process
- Familiarize yourself with Python libraries including: numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn and others.
- Be able to handle common tasks such as file parsing and feature transformation
- Design and implement a decision-tree algorithm.
- Visualize the decision surface and decision trees.
- Be able to plot and visually explore performance of the learned models
- Demonstrate that the algorithm you have designed produces similar results as the out of the box decision tree algorithm available in    sklearn.tree DecisionTreeClassifier()

Part1 of the assignment is get familiarise with python and jupyter notebook. Part2 is about basic data analysis using python.
